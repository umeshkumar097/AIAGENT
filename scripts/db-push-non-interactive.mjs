/**
 * Wraps `drizzle-kit push --force` so it can run under a closed-stdin
 * post-merge / system-update environment.
 *
 * Drizzle's column/table rename-detection picker prints lines like:
 *   "Is <name> column in <table> table created or renamed from another column?"
 *   "Is <name> table created or renamed from another table?"
 * The highlighted default ("❯") is always the safe "+ create …" option,
 * which is what we want — picking a rename would silently drop data.
 *
 * For each unique question we see, we send a single CR to accept the
 * highlighted default. We key by the question line itself, not by the
 * presence of "❯", so re-renders of the same prompt don't double-send,
 * and a brand-new prompt right after a previous one isn't dropped by a
 * time-based throttle.
