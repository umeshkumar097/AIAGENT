// Plugin-only tables: those that live ONLY in plugins/<name>/migrations/*.sql
// (created via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` when the plugin loader boots) and
// are NOT defined in shared/schema.ts. Without this exclusion list, every
// `drizzle-kit push --force` (run during system updates and via npm run
// db:push) sees them as "extra tables not in schema" and DROPS them, wiping
// every row of plugin data (admin_teams, team_members, whatsapp_*, etc.).
//
// IMPORTANT — what does NOT belong here:
// Tables that are in BOTH shared/schema.ts AND a plugin migration (notably
// `api_keys`, `api_audit_logs`, `api_rate_limits`, `sip_calls`,
// `sip_phone_numbers`, `sip_trunks`) are app-managed: drizzle-kit owns the
// schema, the plugin migrations are no-op safety nets. Excluding them would
// silently block legitimate schema-reconciliation pushes for those tables.
// Drizzle was never going to drop them anyway because they ARE in the schema.
//
// New plugin-only tables MUST be added here. New main-app tables added to
// shared/schema.ts need no change because the include glob `*` matches all,
// and only the explicit plugin-only names below are excluded.
