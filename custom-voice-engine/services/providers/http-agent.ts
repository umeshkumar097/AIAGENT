 * Provider HTTP calls (OpenRouter LLM, Deepgram/Sarvam TTS,
 * Sarvam STT) previously used a fresh connection per request,
 * paying a full TCP + TLS handshake on every turn (~100-300ms
 * of avoidable latency each). These shared agents keep sockets
 * warm and pooled so repeated calls to the same host reuse an
 * already-established TLS connection.
